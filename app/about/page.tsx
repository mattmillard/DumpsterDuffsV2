              <p>
                Dumpster Duff&apos;s was founded on a simple principle: make
                waste removal easy, reliable, and affordable for everyone in
                central Missouri. As a veteran-owned business, we bring the same
                work ethic, integrity, and commitment to excellence that we
                learned in military service to every job we do.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started small but had a big vision: to serve our communities
                with professional, friendly dumpster rental service. Today, we
                proudly serve Columbia, Jefferson City, and surrounding areas
                with pride and dedication.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every day, we&apos;re committed to making your project easier.
                Whether you&apos;re renovating your home, clearing out your
                garage, or managing a construction project, we&apos;re here to
                help without the hassle.
